                        <p class="lead fw-normal my-5 mb-0"> 
                            Initially, DaGoose was simply a YouTube channel start-up that consisted of video tutorials for already existing open-source software. After being introduced to the C# computer programming language, Goose took it upon himself to create a new and free media encoding utility called FrameGUI.
                            FrameGUI consisted of a basic user interface that allowed users to conveniently encode video files to different formats and/or apply filters such as sharpening enhancements or frame interpolation. FrameGUI quickly became popular after the official video tutorial was published on DaGoose YouTube channel.
                            To this day, tens of thousands of users have installed FrameGUI and are actively using it.<br /><br />
                            Later, Goose introduced EncodeGUI that was intended to be the successor application to FrameGUI, consisting of far more features and options. Although FrameGUI was later re-released due to user demand, EncodeGUI consists of AI tools and filters that bring an unparalleled encoding experience to the user.
                            To this day, both FrameGUI and EncodeGUI are still actively in development and their user base is growing by the thousands every month.<br /><br />
                            Apart from computer software design, DaGoose also specializes in printed circuit board design. The first published PCB design was DaGoose Box which is a linear Class AB amplifier system that consisted of a custom Class A configurated pre-amplifier that gave the amp a slightly enhanced (3D) soundstage. The linear amplification of the entire system gave natural sounding acoustics when paired with decent speakers.
                            Since year 2020, DaGoose has been actively working on SMT-PBTS which is a small, Hi-Fi Bluetooth audio amplifier board designed for power-hungry speakers in a very small enclosure. To this day, SMT-PBTS is still being devloped to sound better and made smaller in each revision.

                            DaGoose was founded by Garrett Aderholdt, otherwise known as Goose. Goose was initially from Tomsk, Russia and now resides in Virginia, USA. Goose created DaGoose halfway through high school during the COVID-19 lockdowns as an opportunity to share his knowledge relating to computer software and printed circuit board design to the world. Since a young age, Goose has always been fascinated with modern technology and electronic systems. 
                            He started learning about electronics by designing basic audio amplifiers and switching circuits as early as 12 years of age. Goose continued to study and excel with his knowledge in electronic systems in the subsequent high school years and also was introduced to computer science and programming his Freshman year. He initially learned the Python programming language his Freshman year and later learned C#, Java, and C++ in the following academic years.
                            Goose applied these newfound skills by creating free and open-source computer software such as FrameGUI and EncodeGUI at around the same time.<br /><br />
                            Apart from printed circuit board design and software development, Goose was also heavily involved in athletics throughout secondary school. He participated in varsity cross country and varsity indoor/outdoor track for all four years of high school. Goose received a cross country coach's award in 2021, sportsmanship award in 2020, principals list award for 4.0 semester GPA in 2021, and national recognition for a Russian language essay contest.<br /><br />
                            With dreams of pursuing a career or starting a business relating to electronic systems design, Goose has enrolled at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas as a M.S. Computer Engineering major. To this day, Goose is still learning new things and will continue to strive for success in where he does best.
